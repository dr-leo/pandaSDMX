=============
pandaSDMX
=============

pandaSDMX is an Apache 2.0-licensed
client to retrieve and acquire statistical data
and metadata disseminated in
`SDMX <http://www.sdmx.org>`_ 2.1, an ISO-standard
widely used by institutions
such as statistics offices, central banks, and international organisations.
pandaSDMX exposes datasets and related structural metadata
including dataflows, code-lists,
and datastructure definitions as `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`_ Series
or multi-indexed DataFrames. Many other
output formats and storage backends are available thanks to `Odo <http://odo.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Main features
---------------------

* support for many SDMX features including

  - generic and structure specific data sets in SDMXML format
  - data sets in SDMXJSON format
  - data structure definitions, code lists and concept schemes
  - dataflow definitions and content-constraints
  - categorisations and category schemes

* pythonic representation of the SDMX information model
* When requesting datasets, validate column selections against code lists
  and content-constraints if available
* export data and structural metadata such as code lists as multi-indexed pandas DataFrames or Series, and
  many other formats as well as database backends via `Odo`_
* read and write SDMX messages to and from files
* configurable HTTP connections
* support for `requests-cache <https://readthedocs.io/projects/requests-cache/>`_ allowing to cache SDMX messages in
