Frequently asked questions
==========================

Can pandaSDMX connect to SDMX providers other than INSEE, ECB and Eurostat?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any SDMX provider can be supported that generates SDMX 2.1-compliant messages.
INSEE, ECB and Eurostat are hard-coded.  Others may be added in a few lines.
Alternatively, a custom base URL can be provided to the
:meth:`pandasdmx.api.Request.get` method. See the docstring. Support for SDMX
2.0 messages could be added as a new reader module. Perhaps the model would have
to be tweaked a bit as well.


Writing large datasets to pandas DataFrames is slow. What can I do?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The main performance hit comes from parsing the time or time period strings. In
case of regular data such as monthly (not trading day!), call the ``write``
method with ``fromfreq``  set to True so that only the first string will be
parsed and the rest inferred from the frequency of the series. Caution: If the
series is stored in the XML document in reverse chronological order, the
``reverse_obs``  argument must be set to True as well to prevent the resulting
dataframe index from extending into a remote future.
