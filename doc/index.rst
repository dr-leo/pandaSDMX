pandaSDMX: Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange in Python
=============================================================


pandaSDMX is an Apache 2.0-licensed `Python <http://www.python.org>`_
library to retrieve and acquire statistical data
and metadata disseminated in
`SDMX <http://www.sdmx.org>`_ 2.1, an ISO-standard
widely used by institutions
such as statistics offices, central banks, and international organisations.
pandaSDMX exposes datasets and related structural metadata
including dataflows, code-lists,
and datastructure definitions as `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`_ Series
or multi-indexed DataFrames. Many other
output formats and storage backends are available thanks to `Odo <http://odo.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Supported data providers
----------------------------
pandaSDMX ships with built-in support for the following agencies (others may be
configured by the user):

* `Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) <http://www.abs.gov.au/>`_
* `European Central Bank (ECB) <http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/ecb_statistics/co-operation_and_standards/sdmx/html/index.en.html>`_
* `Eurostat <http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/sdmx-web-services/rest-sdmx-2.1>`_
* `French National Institute for Statistics (INSEE)
  <http://www.bdm.insee.fr/bdm2/statique?page=sdmx>`_
* `International Monetary Fund (IMF) - SDMX Central only
  <https://sdmxcentral.imf.org/>`_
* `Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
  <http://stats.oecd.org/SDMX-JSON/>`_
* `United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) <https://unstats.un.org/home/>`_
* `UNESCO (free registration required) <https://apiportal.uis.unesco.org/getting-started>`_
* `World Bank - World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) <wits.worldbank.org>`_


Main features
---------------------

* support for many SDMX features including

  - generic data sets in SDMXML format
  - data sets in SDMXJSON format
  - data structure definitions, code lists and concept schemes
  - dataflow definitions and content-constraints
  - categorisations and category schemes

* pythonic representation of the SDMX information model
* When requesting datasets, validate column selections against code lists
  and content-constraints if available
* export data and structural metadata such as code lists as multi-indexed pandas DataFrames or Series, and
  many other formats as well as database backends via `Odo`_
* read and write SDMX messages to and from files
* configurable HTTP connections
* support for `requests-cache <https://readthedocs.io/projects/requests-cache/>`_ allowing to cache SDMX messages in
  memory, MongoDB, Redis or SQLite
* extensible through custom readers and writers for alternative input and output formats
* growing test suite

Example
---------

Suppose we want to analyze annual unemployment data for some European countries. All we need to know
in advance is the data provider, eurostat. pandaSDMX makes it super easy to
search the directory of dataflows, and the complete structural metadata about the datasets
available through the selected dataflow. We will skip this step here.
The impatient reader may directly jump to :ref:`basic-usage`.
The dataflow with the ID 'une_rt_a' contains the data we want. The dataflow definition references a
datastructure definition with the ID 'DSD_une_rt_a'.
It contains or references all the metadata describing data sets available through this dataflow: the dimensions,
concept schemes, and corresponding code lists.

.. ipython:: python
    :okexcept:

    from pandasdmx import Request
    estat = Request('ESTAT')
    # Download the metadata and expose it as a dict mapping resource names to pandas DataFrames
    metadata = estat.datastructure('DSD_une_rt_a').write()
    # Show some code lists; the performance warning is just an oddity of pandas.
    metadata.codelist.loc[['AGE', 'UNIT']]

Next we download a dataset. We use codes from the code list 'GEO'
to obtain data on Greece, Ireland and Spain only.

.. ipython:: python
    :okexcept:

    resp = estat.data('une_rt_a', key={'GEO': 'EL+ES+IE'}, params={'startPeriod': '2007'})
    # We use a generator expression to select some columns
    # and write them to a pandas DataFrame
    data = resp.write(s for s in resp.data.series if s.key.AGE == 'TOTAL')
    # Explore the data set. First, show dimension names
    data.columns.names
    # and corresponding dimension values
    data.columns.levels
    # Show aggregate unemployment rates across ages and sexes as
    # percentage of active population
    data.loc[:, ('PC_ACT', 'TOTAL', 'T')]

Quick install
