'''
This module defines two classes: :class:`pandasdmx.api.Request` and :class:`pandasdmx.api.Response`.
Together, these form the high-level API of :mod:`pandasdmx`. Requesting data and metadata from
an SDMX server requires a good understanding of this API and a basic understanding of the SDMX web service guidelines
only the chapters on REST services are relevant as pandasdmx does not support the
SOAP interface.

            **http_cfg: used to configure http requests. E.g., you can 
            specify proxies, authentication information and more.

        '''get SDMX data or metadata and return it as a :class:`pandasdmx.api.Response` instance.

        While 'get' can load any SDMX file (also as zip-file) specified by 'fromfile',
        it can only construct URLs for the SDMX service set for this instance.
        Hence, you have to instantiate a :class:`pandasdmx.api.Request` instance for each data provider you want to access, or
        pass a pre-fabricated URL through the ``url`` parameter.

        Args:
            resource_type(str): the type of resource to be requested. Values must be
                one of the items in Request._resources such as 'data', 'dataflow', 'categoryscheme' etc.
                It is used for URL construction, not to read the received SDMX file.
                Hence, if `fromfile` is given, `resource_type` may be ''.
                Defaults to ''.
            resource_id(str): the id of the resource to be requested.
                It is used for URL construction. Defaults to ''.
            agency(str): ID of the agency providing the data or metadata.
                Used for URL construction only. It tells the SDMX web service
                which agency the requested information originates from. Note that
                an SDMX service may provide information from multiple data providers.
                may be '' if `fromfile` is given. Not to be confused
                with the agency ID passed to :meth:`__init__` which specifies
                the SDMX web service to be accessed.
            params(dict): defines the query part of the URL.
                The SDMX web service guidelines (www.sdmx.org) explain the meaning of
                permissible parameters. It can be used to restrict the
                time range of the data to be delivered (startperiod, endperiod), whether parents, siblings or descendants of the specified
                resource should be returned as well (e.g. references='parentsandsiblings'). Sensible defaults
                are set automatically
                depending on the values of other args such as `resource_type`.
                Defaults to {}.
            fromfile(str): path to the file to be loaded instead of
                accessing an SDMX web service. Defaults to None. If `fromfile` is
                given, args relating to URL construction will be ignored.
            tofile(str): file path to write the received SDMX file on the fly. This
                is useful if you want to load data offline using
                `fromfile` or if you want to open an SDMX file in
                an XML editor.
            url(str): URL of the resource to download.
                If given, any other arguments such as
                ``resource_type`` or ``resource_id`` are ignored. Default is None.
            get_footer_url((int, int)): 
                tuple of the form (seconds, number_of_attempts). Determines the
                behavior in case the received SDMX message has a footer where
                one of its lines is a valid URL. ``get_footer_url`` defines how many attempts should be made to
                request the resource at that URL after waiting so many seconds before each attempt.
                This behavior is useful when requesting large datasets from Eurostat. Other agencies do not seem to
                send such footers. Once an attempt to get the resource has been 
                successful, the original message containing the footer is dismissed and the dataset
                is returned. The ``tofile`` argument is propagated. Note that the written file may be
                a zip archive. pandaSDMX handles zip archives since version 0.2.1. Defaults to (30, 3). 

        Returns:
            pandasdmx.api.Response: instance containing the requested
                SDMX Message.
